			Generally environmental degradation takes place due to deforestation that takes place in large amount and due to which various issues are prevailing such as
Climate Imbalance: Deforestation also affects the climate in more than one ways.
Increase in Global Warming: Trees play a major role in controlling global warming .
Soil Erosion: Also due to the shade of trees the soil remains moist.
Floods: When it rains, trees absorb and store large amount...

So to over come this we are trying to protect our forest by using different sensors like
GRID EYE SENSOR AND 
FIRE SENSOR
Grid eye sensor is basically used for tracking the movements of humans in forest so that deforestation can be reduced 
Fire sensor is used to indicate if any smoke or fire is evolve so that more damage can be avoided.

								<p>" GRID EYE SENSOR "</p>
			Grid-EYE is an infrared array sensor and the ﬁrst ever 64 pixel IR camera in an all-in-one compact SMD package. Based on MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology, Grid-EYE combines the MEMS sensor chip, a digital ASIC (I2C interface) and a silicon lens. It has 64 thermopile elements in an 8x8 grid format that detect absolute surface temperature without any contact. Unlike conventional sensors, Grid-EYE uses a patented 60° silicon lens etched out of a silicon wafer, which is (with less than 0.3mm height) the smallest available lens in the market. The combination of these technologies from Panasonic enables to reduce the sensor package size to only 11.6mm x 8mm x 4.3mm, which is around 70% smaller in size than competitor products. 
Compared to single element thermopile sensors and pyroelectric sensors, it is not only possible to detect moving people and objects but also the position and presence of motionless people and objects, the direction of movements and the accurate surface temperature from -20°C up to +100°C . With this wide range of temperature measurement Panasonic is able to reach a NETD (Noise equivalent temperature difference) of +/- 0.08°C @ 1Hz at room temperature. Its coordinated array of sensing elements can even detect multiple people or objects moving in different directions. At close proximity, Grid-EYE is even capable of detecting hand movements for simple gesture control.

								<p>" INSTALLATION"</p>
								There is a central server in the sensor network, the sensors can transmit their observations to this central server directly without any processing or they can extract the useful information from their measurements and make decisions to be sent to the central server in distributed detection.
First, we studied the number of cameras, multisensors, a device developed by us that is able to sense different type of parameters, and access points that are needed to cover a rural or forest area. We also studied the scalability of the system. The system mixes multisensors with IP cameras in a wireless mesh network in order to detect and verify fire and human movement thus minimizing the reaction time of the fire fighters and,tree cutters  therefore, the effects of the fire and deforestation in rural and forest areas of Spain. 
When a fire and any human movement is detected by a wireless multisensor, the sensor alarm is sent through the wireless network to a central server. The central server runs a software application that selects the closest wireless cameras to the multisensory and gives them coordinates to rotate to the multisensor that raised the alarm, and sends them a message in order to receive real-time images from the zone. It will let the fire fighters corroborate the detected fire and we can stop people from cutting down the trees. We will also research the power consumption of the devices involved in this deployment in order to demonstrate that it is sustainable.

								<p>" FIRE CENSOR"</p>
								A fire detector works by detecting smoke and heat. These devices respond to the presence of smoke or extremely high temperatures that are present with a fire. After the device has been activated, it will send a signal to the alarm system to perform the programmed response for that zone.
Since a fire detector usually works by detecting smoke and/or heat, and not actual fire, these devices are not usually called "fire detectors". Instead, these devices are more appropriately called "smoke detectors" and "heat detectors". Some of these devices are single-function devices that will only detect either smoke or high temperatures. However, other sensors are multi-function, and they will detect the presence of both smoke and high temperatures.
